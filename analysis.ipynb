    "This notebook contains my end‑to‑end work on predicting fourth‑down conversion probability. I load a cleaned snapshot of play‑by‑play data, create only pre‑play features (no leakage), fit and evaluate classifiers, and save a final model and scaler for interactive use in the dashboard. The final decision threshold I use is 0.45 (45%): probability >= 0.45 → recommend \"go for it\"."

    "## 2 — Load and clean real NFL play‑by‑play data (nfldata.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "I load a targeted subset of the full play‑by‑play CSV (only the columns I expect to need) so the notebook stays responsive while I work interactively. My cleaning steps are intentional and conservative — I keep only plays that are realistic candidates for a \"go for it\" decision and I avoid any post‑play information that would leak the outcome into features.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I do and why:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read only the columns I need (keeps memory usage low). If the CSV changes shape this step is resilient: I check which requested columns are available and proceed with the intersection.\n",
    "- Filter to 4th‑down plays and keep only offensive pass/run attempts — this restricts the dataset to real decisions where \"go for it\" is applicable (teams otherwise might punt, kick or kneel).\n",
    "- Keep only rows that have a definitive `fourth_down_converted` label (our supervised target). Ambiguous or missing labels are dropped because they can't be used for learning.\n",
    "- Drop rows missing the minimal pre‑play numeric fields we rely on (`ydstogo`, `yardline_100`). These fields are essential for model inputs; rather than guessing, I conservatively remove incomplete rows.\n",
    "- Convert the target to integer (0/1) to ensure consistent training behavior.\n",
    "- Convert boolean‑like indicators (`shotgun`, `no_huddle`, `qb_dropback`) to numeric 0/1 to make them usable by sklearn models.\n",
    "- For categorical fields like `pass_length` and `pass_location`, replace missing values with the string `'NA'` and one‑hot encode them to preserve situational signals without introducing leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes / limitations:\n",
    "- This pipeline is deliberately conservative: I prefer dropping a few ambiguous rows rather than risk leakage or incorrect labels. If you want to keep more rows, we can add imputation rules or a more nuanced missing‑value strategy.\n",
    "- The selection of columns and pre‑play features is flexible — I document the set of 'base' features used and the pipeline so you (or others) can adapt it to different datasets or include additional situational fields.\n",
    "- Because the CSV is large, these steps balance correctness with interactivity; running the full pipeline in a batch job (or on a more powerful machine) is an easy next step if you want to expand the feature set or tune imputation."

    "## 3 — Train a classifier (Logistic Regression)\n",
    "\n",
    "I start with Logistic Regression as my interpretable baseline and document the steps carefully so the model decisions are explainable during presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key choices and why:\n",
    "- Model: Logistic Regression (binary) — I chose it because it provides direct, interpretable coefficients and outputs well-calibrated probabilities, which I can turn into a go/no‑go recommendation using a probability threshold.\n",
    "- Train/test split: I reserve 25% of the cleaned data for testing and use stratified splits so the class balance (converted vs not converted) remains consistent across folds and held‑out evaluation.\n",
    "- Scaling: I standardize all features using a StandardScaler. Because I use one‑hot encodings for categorical fields and numeric variables with different units/ranges, scaling ensures the regularization and coefficients behave sensibly.\n",
    "- Regularization & solver: The implementation uses liblinear (L2 by default). Regularization prevents overfitting when features are correlated and keeps the learned coefficients stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "How I convert probability into a decision:\n",
    "- The model returns a probability that the 4th‑down attempt converts. I use a decision threshold of 0.45 — probability >= 0.45 → recommend GO; otherwise NO GO. I chose 0.45 to reflect the project’s conservative decisioning policy (closer to the calibrated trade‑off we want), but the threshold is easy to adjust during analysis or production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation metrics I report:\n",
    "- Accuracy: overall agreement with true labels (useful for broad sense of correctness, but can hide class imbalance behavior).\n",
    "- Precision: of the plays predicted as conversions, how many actually converted (reduces false positives — important when avoiding risky calls).\n",
    "- Recall: of the true conversions, how many were correctly identified (helps understand missed conversion opportunities).\n",
    "- Confusion matrix: a compact view of true/false positives and negatives so I can explain practical impacts (e.g., how often model recommends a risky 'go' that fails).\n",
    "\n",
    "This baseline gives me a transparent tool to explain the model’s behavior, compare more complex models against it, and inspect which features the model is relying on by examining coefficient magnitudes and signs."

    "## 3b — Model selection and final training (detailed)\n",
    "\n",
    "I compare two practical approaches and pick the one that best generalizes to unseen plays:\n",
    "\n",
    "What I compare\n",
    "- Logistic Regression (regularized) — interpretable, gives coefficients that are easy to explain and reason about.\n",
    "- Random Forest — often picks up complex, non‑linear interactions and is robust to noisy features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Search & validation procedure\n",
    "- I run a limited grid search over sensible hyperparameter values for both estimators. For Logistic Regression I tune regularization strength and class weighting; for Random Forest I tune  n_estimators, depth and class weight.\n",
    "- I use 5‑fold stratified cross‑validation and ROC AUC as the selection metric. Stratified folds keep the conversion rate consistent across folds, and AUC focuses on the model’s ranking ability which is often more informative than raw accuracy for probability‐based decisioning.\n",
    "- This cross‑validated selection helps me avoid choosing a model that overfits a specific split or favours an arbitrary metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final training\n",
    "- Once I pick the best estimator by CV AUC, I retrain it on the entire cleaned dataset so the final model benefits from all available labeled data.\n",
    "- I fit a StandardScaler on the full feature matrix and transform features before the final fit — this ensures the saved scaler and model are consistent and can be reused in the dashboard and helpers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why these choices\n",
    "- The logistic baseline gives me a clear, explainable model I can present and use to show how particular features change the odds of success (e.g., how yards to go affects conversion probability).\n",
    "- The Random Forest is a complementary check for performance. If it substantially improves AUC I use it instead — but only after validating the improvement with cross‑validation and inspecting feature importances so the decision is explainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Saved artifacts\n",
    "- I save the chosen estimator and the scaler so downstream code (dashboard and prediction helpers) can load and use them without retraining.\n",
    "- I also save the final ordered feature list (features.joblib) used for training so the dashboard and single‑play helpers can construct inputs in the exact same order — that avoids feature-mismatch problems at prediction time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical notes\n",
    "- If we need stricter model interpretability in a production setting, the logistic model remains an excellent option (it’s transparent and easy to audit). If we need additional accuracy and the Random Forest is measurably better, I’ll keep it but document the explanation strategy (e.g., top feature importances and partial dependence where necessary).\n",
    "- Everything here is configured to be repeatable: the search, selection metric and final training are deterministic given the fixed random seed so you can reproduce the same final artifacts anytime."
